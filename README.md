index.py parses through json files and stores the data into a url dictionary. Then the dictionary is iterated through and utilizes tokenization functions from our assignments earlier in the course to parse through the content. An inverted index dictionary is created and is used to generate the report for milestone 1.

The proper report could only be generated from local machine, as attempting to parse through the entire DEV folder's jsons files went through errors decoding.
